We now know everything we need to know^[For our purposes! Of course, there is a *lot* that we could still ask, but we leave these questions to quantum physicists, or scientists working in a lab.] about a single qubit and its quantum behaviour.
But if we want to understand quantum computation --- a complicated quantum interference of many interacting qubits --- then we will need few more mathematical tools.
Stepping up from one qubit to two or more is a bigger leap than you might expect.
Already, with just two qubits, we will encounter the remarkable phenomenon of **quantum entanglement** and have a chance to discuss some of the most puzzling features of quantum theory that took people decades to understand.

## A very brief history {#a-very-brief-history}

The notion of **quantum entanglement** was the subject of many early debates that focused on the meaning of quantum theory.
Back in the 1930s, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger (to mention just the usual suspects) were trying hard to understand its conceptual consequences.^[E. Schrödinger, "Discussion of probability relations between separated system". *Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society* **31** (1935), pp. 555--563.]
Einstein, the most sceptical of them all, claimed that it was pointing toward the fatal flaw in quantum theory, and referred to it as "spooky action at a distance" ("*spukhafte Fernwirkung*").
In contrast, Schrödinger was much more prepared to accept quantum theory exactly as it was formulated, along with all its predictions, no matter how weird they might be.
In his 1935 paper, which introduced quantum entanglement, he wrote "I would not call it *one* but rather *the* characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought".

Today we still talk a lot about quantum entanglement, but more often it is viewed as a physical resource which enables us to communicate with perfect security, build very precise atomic clocks, and even teleport small quantum objects!
But what exactly is quantum entanglement?





## From one qubit to two

<div class="video" title="Dimension argument for entanglement" data-videoid="Y52d8Awh96g"></div>

In classical physics, the transition from a single object to a composite system of many objects is trivial: in order to describe the state of, say, 42 objects at any given moment of time, it is sufficient to describe the state of each of the objects separately.
Indeed, the classical state of 42 point-like particles is described by specifying the position and the momentum of each particle.

::: {.idea latex=""}
In the *classical* world, "the whole is *exactly* the sum of its parts"; in the *quantum* world, Aristotle had it right when he said "the whole is *greater than* the sum of its parts".
:::

Consider, for example, a pair of qubits.
Suppose that each one is described by a state vector: the first one by $\ket{a}$, and the second one by $\ket{b}$.
One might therefore think that the most general state of the two qubits should be represented by a pair of state vectors, $\ket{a}\ket{b}$, with one for each qubit.
Indeed, such a state is certainly possible, but there are other states that *cannot* be expressed in this form.
In order to write down the most general state of two qubits we first focus on the basis states.

For a single qubit we have been using the standard basis $\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}$.
For two qubits we may choose the following as our standard basis states:^[It looks like we are defining some sort of "multiplication rule" for kets here, saying that $\ket{a}\ket{b}:=\ket{ab}$. This is indeed the case, but to talk about this properly we need to introduce the idea of **tensor products** (which we do very soon, in Section \@ref(tensor-products)).]
$$
  \begin{array}{cc}
    \ket{00} \equiv \ket{0}\ket{0}
    & \ket{01} \equiv \ket{0}\ket{1}
  \\\ket{10} \equiv \ket{1}\ket{0}
    &\ket{11} \equiv \ket{1}\ket{1}.
  \end{array}
$$
Within each ket, the first symbol refers to the first qubit, and the second to the second, and we have tacitly assumed that we can distinguish the two qubits by their location, or some other means.

Now, the most general state of the two qubits (a **bipartite** state) is a normalised linear combination of these four basis states, i.e. a vector of the form
$$
  \ket{\psi}
  = c_{00}\ket{00} + c_{01}\ket{01} + c_{10}\ket{10} + c_{11}\ket{11}.
$$
Physical interpretation aside, let us count how many real parameters are needed to specify this state.
Six, right?
We have four complex numbers (the $c_{ij}$), which gives *eight* real parameters; we then restrict by the normalisation condition, along with the fact that states differing only by a global phase factor are equivalent, which leaves us with *six* real parameters.
Now, by the same line of argument, we need only *two* real parameters to specify the state of a single qubit, and hence need *four* real parameters to specify any state of two qubits of the form $\ket{a}\ket{b}$.

But four is less than six!
So it *cannot* be the case that every state of two qubits can be expressed as a pair of states $\ket{a}\ket{b}$, simply for "dimension reasons".

For example, compare the two states of two qubits,
$$
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{00} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{01}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{00} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{11}.
$$
The first one is **separable**, i.e. we can view it as a pair of state vectors where each one pertains to one of the two qubits:
$$
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{00} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{01}
  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \;\;
  \underbrace{\vphantom{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}\ket{0}}_{\text{qubit 1}}
  \;\;
  \underbrace{(\ket{0}+\ket{1})}_{\text{qubit 2}},
$$
The second state, however, does *not* admit such a decomposition: there do *not* exist *any* $\psi_1,\psi_2$ such that
$$
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{00} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{11}
  = \ket{\psi_1}\ket{\psi_2}
$$
and so we say that it is an **entangled** state.

::: {.idea}
Any bipartite state that cannot be viewed as a pair of two states pertaining to the constituent subsystems is said to be **entangled**.
:::

We'll give another, equivalent but more mathematical (and notational), definition of entanglement once we understand how tensor products work.





## Quantum theory, formally (continued) {#tensor-products}

In Section \@ref(quantum-theory-formally), we said that we were missing a key part in our formalism of quantum theory --- now we can finally fill in this hole.
Our mathematical formalism of choice behind the quantum theory of composite systems is based on the **tensor product** of Hilbert spaces.

### Tensor products {-}

Let the states of some system $\mathcal{A}$ be described by vectors in an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$, and the states of some system $\mathcal{B}$ by vectors in an $m$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$.
The combined system of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is then described by vectors in the $nm$-dimensional **tensor product space** $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$.
Given bases $\{\ket{a_1},\ldots,\ket{a_n}\}$ of $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$ and $\{\ket{b_1},\ldots,\ket{b_m}\}$ of $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$, we form a basis of the tensor product by taking the ordered pairs $\ket{a_i}\otimes\ket{b_j}$, for $i=1,\ldots,n$ and $j=1,\ldots,m$.
For brevity, we sometimes write $\ket{a_i}\otimes\ket{b_j}$ as $\ket{a_i}\ket{b_j}$, or simply $\ket{a_ib_j}$.
The tensor product space $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$ then consists of all linear combination of such tensor product basis vectors:^[If the bases $\{\ket{a_i}\}$ and $\{\ket{b_j}\}$ are orthonormal then so too is the tensor product basis $\{\ket{a_i}\otimes\ket{b_j}\}$.]
$$
  \ket{\psi}
  = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij}\ket{a_i}\otimes\ket{b_j}.
\tag{$\ddagger$}
$$

The tensor product operation $\otimes$ is distributive:
$$
  \begin{gathered}
    \ket{a} \otimes \left( \beta_1\ket{b_1} + \beta_2\ket{b_2} \right)
    = \beta_1\ket{a}\otimes\ket{b_1} + \beta_2\ket{a}\otimes\ket{b_2}
  \\\left( \alpha_1\ket{a_1} + \alpha_2\ket{a_2} \right) \otimes \ket{b}
    = \alpha_1\ket{a_1}\otimes\ket{b} + \alpha_2\ket{a_2}\otimes\ket{b}.
  \end{gathered}
$$

The tensor product of Hilbert spaces is again a Hilbert space: the inner products on $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$ give a natural inner product on $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$, defined for any two product vectors by
$$
  \left( \bra{a'}\otimes\bra{b'} \right) \left( \ket{a}\otimes\ket{b} \right)
  = \braket{a'}{a}\braket{b'}{b}
$$
and extended by linearity to sums of tensor products of vectors, and, by associativity^[Associativity means that $({\mathcal{H}}_a \otimes {\mathcal{H}}_b)\otimes {\mathcal{H}}_c = {\mathcal{H}}_a \otimes ({\mathcal{H}}_b\otimes {\mathcal{H}}_c)$.], to any number of subsystems.
Note that the bra corresponding to the tensor product state $\ket{a}\otimes\ket{b}$ is written as $(\ket{a}\otimes\ket{b})^\dagger = \bra{a}\otimes\bra{b}$, where the order of the factors on either side of $\otimes$ does *not* change when the dagger operation is applied.

Some joint states of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ can be expressed as a single tensor product, say $\ket{\psi}=\ket{a}\otimes\ket{b}$, meaning that the subsystem $\mathcal{A}$ is in state $\ket{a}$, and the subsystem $\mathcal{B}$ in state $\ket{b}$.
If we expand $\ket{a}=\sum_i\alpha_i\ket{a_i}$ and $\ket{b}=\sum_i\beta_j\ket{b_j}$, then $\ket{\psi}=\sum_{i,j}\alpha_i\beta_j\ket{a_i}\otimes\ket{b_j}$ and we see that, for all such states, the coefficients $c_{ij}$ in Equation ($\ddagger$) are of a rather special form:
$$
  c_{ij} = \alpha_i\beta_j.
$$
We call such states **separable** (or **product states**).
States that are not separable are said to be **entangled**.

A useful fact about tensor products is that $\lambda a\otimes b = a\otimes\lambda b$ (where $a$ and $b$ are vectors, and $\lambda$ is a scalar).
This means that we don't need to worry about where exactly we put $\lambda$, and can write something like $\lambda(a\otimes b)$.

We will also need the concept of the tensor product of two operators.
If $A$ is an operator on $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$ and $B$ an operator on $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$, then the tensor product operator $A\otimes B$ is an operator on $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$ defined by its action on product vectors via
$$
  (A\otimes B)(\ket{a}\otimes\ket{b}) = (A\ket{a})\otimes (B\ket{b})
$$
and with its action on all other vectors determined by linearity:
$$
  A\otimes B \left( \sum_{i,j} c_{ij}\ket{a_i}\otimes\ket{b_j} \right)
  = \sum_{i,j}c_{ij} A\ket{a_i}\otimes B\ket{b_j}.
$$

::: {.technical title="The universal property of the tensor product" latex="{The universal property of the tensor product}"}
We have described the tensor product in terms of how it acts on bases, and then extended everything by linearity, distributivity, and associativity.
But there are other, more abstract approaches to defining the tensor product.

For example, given two vector spaces $V$ and $W$, we can construct their tensor product $V\otimes W$ as a *quotient* of the cartesian product $V\times W$ (whose elements are simply pairs $(v,w)$ of vectors in $V$ and vectors in $W$) by the subspace spanned by the relations that we want the tensor product to satisfy:
$$
  \begin{gathered}
    (v_1+v_2,w)-(v_1,w)-(v_2,w),
  \\(v,w_1+w_2)-(v,w_1)-(v,w_2),
  \\(\lambda v,w)-\lambda(v,w),
  \\(v,\lambda w)-\lambda(v,w).
  \end{gathered}
$$

But really this is hinting at the so-called [**universal property**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_property) that defines the tensor product without giving a choice of explicit construction: the tensor product of $V$ and $W$ is defined to be any vector space $A$ along with a bilinear map $\otimes\colon V\times W\to A$ such that, for any *other* vector space $Z$ along with a bilinear map $f\colon V\times W\to Z$, there exists a *unique* linear map $\tilde{f}\colon A\to Z$ such that $f=\tilde{f}\circ\otimes$.
In the language of category theory, the tensor product is the **initial object** amongst vector spaces endowed with a bilinear map from $V\times W$; any other vector space $Z$ with a bilinear map $V\times W\to Z$ *factors through* the tensor product.

One specific reason to care about giving a definition in terms of universal property is that this guarantees (by some [abstract nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense)) that the resulting object will be unique ("up to unique isomorphism") whenever it exists, so you don't need to worry about proving this separately.

Tensor products are much more general than just for vector spaces: they can be [defined for modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product_of_modules) (which are like vector spaces over an arbitrary commutative ring, instead of over a field), and abelian groups are, it turns out, exactly "modules over $\mathbb{Z}$", so they also have a notion of tensor product.
Going a bit deeper, we can define tensor products for **complexes** of modules and **sheaves** of modules, and these constructions are absolutely fundamental to modern algebraic geometry.

Going even deeper still (and now far beyond the purview of this book), tensor products are generalised by the notion of [**monoidal categories**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category).

As a final note, the universal property of the tensor product can be used to prove that we do not need to impose the postulate "the Hilbert space of a composite system is the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of its components", but that this actually follows "for free" from the **state** and the **measurement postulates**.
This is shown in Carcassi, Maccone, and Aidala's "The four postulates of quantum mechanics are three", arXiv:[2003.11007](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11007).

## More qubits, and binary representations {#more-than-two-qubits-and-binary}

Let's see how this formalism works for qubits.
The $n$-fold tensor product of vectors from the standard basis $\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}$ represent binary strings of length $n$.
For example, for $n=3$,
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \ket{0}\otimes\ket{1}\otimes\ket{1}
    & \equiv \ket{011}
  \\\ket{1}\otimes\ket{1}\otimes\ket{1}
    & \equiv \ket{111}.
  \end{aligned}
$$
A *classical* **register** (that is, a collection of bits) composed of three bits can store *only one* of these two binary strings at any time; a *quantum* register composed of three qubits can store *both of them* in a superposition.

Indeed, if we start with the state $\ket{011}$ and apply the Hadamard gate to the first qubit (which is the same as applying $H\otimes\id\otimes\id$), then, given that linear combinations distribute over tensor products, we obtain
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \ket{011}
    \xmapsto{H\otimes\id\otimes\id}
    &\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\ket{0} + \ket{1}\big) \otimes\ket{1}\otimes\ket{1}
  \\=
    &\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\ket{011} + \ket{111}\big).
  \end{aligned}
$$

In fact, we can even prepare this register in a superposition of all eight possible binary strings of length 3 at once: if we apply the tensor product operation $H\otimes H\otimes H$ to the state $\ket{0}\otimes\ket{0}\otimes\ket{0} = \ket{000}$ then we get

```{r,engine='tikz',engine.opts=list(template="latex/tikz2pdf.tex"),fig.width=6}
\begin{equation*}
  \left.
  \begin{quantikz}
    \lstick{$\ket{0}$}
    & \gate{H}
    & \qw \rstick{$\frac{\ket{0}+\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$}
  \\\lstick{$\ket{0}$}
    & \gate{H}
    & \qw \rstick{$\frac{\ket{0}+\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$}
  \\\lstick{$\ket{0}$}
    & \gate{H}
    & \qw \rstick{$\frac{\ket{0}+\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$}
  \end{quantikz}
  \right\}
  = \frac{1}{2^{3/2}}
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{r}
      \ket{000} + \ket{001} + \ket{010} + \ket{011}
    \\ + \ket{100} + \ket{101} + \ket{110} + \ket{111}
    \end{array}
  \right\}.
\end{equation*}
```

The resulting state is exactly a superposition of *all* binary strings of length 3, and can also be written as
$$
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\ket{0} + \ket{1}\big)
  \otimes
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\ket{0} + \ket{1}\big)
  \otimes
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\ket{0} + \ket{1}\big).
$$

In general, the tensor product operation $H^{\otimes n}$, which means "apply the Hadamard gate to each of your $n$ qubits", is known as the **Hadamard transform**, and it maps product states to product states.
Like the Hadamard gate in the typical quantum interference circuit, the Hadamard transform opens (and closes) multi-qubit interference.

One final note is on notation, or maybe more a shift of point-of-view.
We have just explained how applying the Hadamard transform to $n$ qubits gives us the equally weighted superposition of all binary strings of length $n$.
But rather than writing them as binary strings, we could consider the decimal number represented by each string.
This means we switch from considering all binary strings of length $n$ to considering all natural numbers from $0$ to $N-1$, where $N=2^n$.
For example, with $n=3$ qubits, we could either write
$$
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x\in\{0,1\}^n} \ket{x}
$$
or instead switch to the decimal approach with $N=2^n=8$ and write
$$
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \ket{x}
$$
so that we are writing $\ket{7}$ to mean $\ket{111}$, and $\ket{3}$ to mean $\ket{011}$, and $\ket{0}$ to mean $\ket{000}$, and so on.





## Separable or entangled? {#separable-or-entangled}

::: {.idea latex=""}
"*Most*" vectors in $\mathcal{H}_a\otimes \mathcal{H}_b$ are **entangled**: they *cannot* be written as product states $\ket{a}\otimes\ket{b}$ with $\ket{a}\in\mathcal{H}_a$ and $\ket{b}\in\mathcal{H}_b$.
:::

In order to see this, let us write any joint state $\ket{\psi}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ in a product basis as
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \ket{\psi}
    &= \sum_{i,j} c_{ij}\ket{a_i}\otimes\ket{b_j}
  \\&= \sum_i\ket{a_i}\otimes\left(\sum_j c_{ij}\ket{b_j}\right)
  \\&= \sum_i\ket{a_i}\otimes\ket{\phi_i}
  \end{aligned}
\tag{$\ddagger$}
$$
where the $\ket{\phi_i}=\sum_j c_{ij}\ket{b_j}$ are vectors in $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$ that need not be normalised.

Now, for any *product* state, these vectors have a special form.
Indeed, if $\ket{\psi}= \ket{a}\otimes\ket{b}$ then, after expanding the first state in the $\ket{a_i}$ basis, we obtain
$$
  \ket{\psi}
  = \sum_{i}\ket{a_i}\otimes\left(\sum_i\alpha_i\ket{b}\right).
$$
This expression has the same form as Equation ($\ddagger$) with $\ket{\phi_i}=\alpha_i\ket{b}$, i.e. each of the $\ket{\phi_i}$ vectors in this expansion is a multiple of the same vector $\ket{b}$.

Conversely, if $\ket{\phi_i} = \alpha_i\ket{b}$ for all $i$ in Equation ($\ddagger$), then $\ket{\psi}$ must be a product state.^[Even though an entangled state cannot be written as a single tensor product, it can always be written as a *linear combination* of tensor products, since these form a basis.]
So if we want to identify which joint states are product states and which are not, we simply write the joint state according to Equation ($\ddagger$) and check if all the vectors $\ket{\phi_i}$ are multiples of a single vector.
Needless to say, if we choose the states $\ket{\phi}$ randomly, it is very unlikely that this condition is satisfied, and we almost certainly pick an entangled state.
In general, given $n$ qubits, we need $2(2^n-1)$ real parameters to describe their state vector, but only $2n$ to describe separable states; as $n$ grows larger, $2n$ becomes much *much* smaller than $2(2^n-1)$.

::: {.technical title="The Segre embedding" latex="{The Segre embedding}"}
The problem of deciding whether or not a given state is separable is, in general, a hard problem (i.e. [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness)).
Because of this, it is interesting to try to understand the notion of separability from different points of view, and it turns out that algebraic geometry yet again has something interesting to say.
The theory relies on the notion of [**projective space**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space), which is a non-trivial topic to try to introduce here, so we do so only briefly, and at a very high speed.

We have repeatedly said that we only really care about state vectors *up to global phase*, i.e. that $\ket{\psi}$ and $\ket{\psi'}$ are "the same" if there exists some $\theta$ such that $\ket{\psi}=e^{i\theta}\ket{\psi'}$.
Combining this with our unitality requirement (that we want $|\braket{\psi}{\psi}|^2=1$), we are led to studying the equivalence relation
$$
  v\sim w \iff v=\lambda w \text{ for some }\lambda\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}
$$
on our Hilbert space.
Geometrically, this can be understood as *the space of lines through the origin*, i.e. of $1$-dimensional subspaces, but the geometry of projective space is a subject that really deserves many *many* pages to delve into, and so we won't talk about this point of view here.

Algebraically, it turns out that we can describe the space of such equivalence classes using **homogeneous coordinates**.
Defining **projective $n$-space** as
$$
  \mathbb{P}^n
  \coloneqq \mathbb{C}^{n+1}/\sim
$$
(where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation defined above), it turns out that points in $\mathbb{P}^n$ are described by coordinates
$$
  [a_0:a_1:\ldots:a_n]
$$
where $a_i\in\mathbb{C}$ are *not all simultaneously zero* (i.e. there exists at least one $i\in\{0,\ldots,n\}$ such that $a_i\neq0$) and where we impose that
$$
  [a_0:a_1:\ldots:a_n]
  = [\lambda a_0:\lambda a_1:\ldots:\lambda a_n]
$$
for any $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$.

Why is this useful?
Well, given any pure state $\alpha_0\ket{0}+\alpha_1\ket{1}$ of a qubit, we obtain a unique point in $\mathbb{P}^1$, namely $[\alpha_0:\alpha_1]$ (since $|\braket{\psi}{\psi}|^2=1$ tells us that at least one of $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ is non-zero);
conversely, given any point $[a_0:a_1]\in\mathbb{P}^1$, we can multiply by an appropriate $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$ to assume that $|a_0|^2+|a_1|^2=1$, and thus obtain a unique (up to global phase) pure state $a_0\ket{0}+a_1\ket{1}$.
That is, *points in the [**(complex) projective line**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere) $\mathbb{P}^1$ correspond to pure states of a qubit*.

Next, we can always express a pure state of *two* qubits in the form
$$
  \beta_0\ket{00} + \beta_1\ket{01} + \beta_2\ket{10} + \beta_3\ket{11}
$$
and we similarly find a correspondence with points $[z_0:z_1:z_2:z_3]$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$ (given, in one direction, by setting $z_i\coloneqq\beta_i$).

What is of interest to us here is a particular map known as the [**Segre embedding**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segre_embedding):
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \sigma\colon\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1
    &\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}^3
  \\([a_0:a_1],[b_0:b_n])
    &\longmapsto
    [a_0b_0:a_0b_1:a_1b_0:a_1b_1].
  \end{aligned}
$$
First of all, one needs to check that this does indeed give a well defined function (i.e. that the resulting coordinate always has at least one non-zero component, and that it is invariant under multiplication by a non-zero scalar $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$).
But it turns out that, not only is this a well defined function, but it is actually a "geometric" function, in that it respects the "geometric structure" of projective space.
We won't concern ourselves here with what that means, but we note that it is *even more* well behaved than this: as its name suggests, it actually gives an **embedding** (i.e. a "geometric" injection) of the $2$-dimensional space $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ into the $3$-dimensional space $\mathbb{P}^3$.

The image of the Segre embedding is called the **Segre variety**, and you can check that it is given by the set of points
$$
  \Sigma
  \coloneqq \operatorname{Im}(\sigma)
  = \big\{ [z_0:z_1:z_2:z_3]\in\mathbb{P}^3 \mid z_0z_3-z_1z_2=0 \big\}
$$
(in algebraic-geometry language, it is the **zero-locus** of a single polynomial).

Now here is the punchline to all this geometric meandering: *a state $\ket{\phi}$ of two qubits is separable if and only if its corresponding point in $\mathbb{P}^3$ lies in the Segre variety $\Sigma$*.

For more, see e.g. Cirici, Salvadó, and Taron's "Characterization of quantum entanglement via a hypercube of Segre embeddings", arXiv:[2008.09583](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09583)).

Quantum entanglement is one of the most fascinating aspects of quantum theory.
We will now explore some of its computational implications.






## Controlled-NOT

<div class="video" title="Controlled-NOT" data-videoid="1PJonQOi5M8"></div>

How do entangled states arise in real physical situations?
The short answer is that *entanglement is the result of interactions*.
It is easy to see that tensor product operations $U_1\otimes\ldots\otimes U_n$ map product states to product states:

```{r,engine='tikz',engine.opts=list(template="latex/tikz2pdf.tex"),fig.width=6}

  \ket{\psi'_1}\otimes\ldots\otimes\ket{\psi'_n}
\end{equation*}
```

and so any collection of separable qubits remains separable.
As soon as qubits start interacting with one another, however, they become entangled, and things start to get really interesting.
We will describe interactions that cannot be written as tensor products of unitary operations on individual qubits.

The most popular two-qubit entangling gate is the **controlled-$\NOT$** (or $\cNOT$), also known as the **controlled-$X$** gate.^[Here, $X\equiv\sigma_x$ refers to the Pauli operator that implements the bit-flip.]
The gate acts on two qubits: it flips the second qubit (referred to as the **target**) if the first qubit (referred to as the **control**) is $\ket{1}$, and does nothing if the control qubit is $\ket{0}$.
In the standard basis $\{\ket{00},\ket{01},\ket{10},\ket{11}\}$, it is represented by the following unitary matrix:

\end{tabular}
:::

We represent the $\cNOT$ gate in circuit notation as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:c-not-diagram).

(ref:c-not-diagram-caption) Where $x,y\in\{0,1\}$, and $\oplus$ denotes $\texttt{XOR}$, or addition modulo $2$.

  \\\lstick{$\ket{y}$}
    & \targ \qw
    & \qw \rstick{$\ket{x\oplus y}$}
  \end{quantikz}
\end{equation*}
```

Note that this gate does not admit any tensor-product decomposition, but can be written as a sum of tensor products:^[Make sure that you understand how the Dirac notation is used here. More generally, think why $$\proj{0}\otimes A + \proj{1}\otimes B$$ means "_if the first qubit is in state $\ket{0}$ then apply $A$ to the second one, and if the first qubit is in state $\ket{1}$ then apply $B$ to the second one_". What happens if the first qubit is in a superposition of $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$?]
$$
  \cNOT
  = \proj{0}\otimes\id + \proj{1}\otimes X
$$
(where $X$ is the Pauli bit-flip operation).

The $\cNOT$ gate lets us do many interesting things, and can act in a rather deceptive way.
Let us now study some of these things.






## Bell states {#bell-states}

<div class="video" title="Bell states" data-videoid="jWzTMtFiG8k"></div>

We start with the generation of entanglement.
Here is a simple circuit that demonstrates the entangling power of $\cNOT$:^[John Stewart Bell (1928--1990) was a Northern Irish physicist.]

In this circuit, the separable input $\ket{0}\ket{0}$ evolves as
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \ket{0}\ket{0}
    \xmapsto{H}& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{0} + \ket{1}) \ket{0}
  \\=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0}\ket{0} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}\ket{0}
  \\\xmapsto{\cNOT}& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0}\ket{0} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}\ket{1}
  \end{aligned}
$$
resulting in the entangled output $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00}+\ket{11})$.
In fact, this circuit implements the unitary operation which maps the standard computational basis into the four entangled states, known as the **Bell states**.

::: {.idea latex=""}
The **Bell states** $\ket{\psi_{ij}}$ are those generated by the above circuit:
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \ket{00}
    &\longmapsto
    \ket{\psi_{00}} \coloneqq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00}+\ket{11})
  \\\ket{01}
    &\longmapsto
    \ket{\psi_{01}} \coloneqq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{01}+\ket{10})
  \\\ket{10}
    &\longmapsto
    \ket{\psi_{10}} \coloneqq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00}-\ket{11})
  \\\ket{11}
    &\longmapsto
    \ket{\psi_{11}} \coloneqq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{01}-\ket{10})
  \end{aligned}
$$
The more standard notation for these states, however, is the following:
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \Phi^+ &\coloneqq \ket{\psi_{00}}
  \\\Psi^+ &\coloneqq \ket{\psi_{01}}
  \\\Phi^- &\coloneqq \ket{\psi_{10}}
  \\\Psi^-&\coloneqq \ket{\psi_{11}}
  \end{aligned}
$$
(and this is the notation that we will use from now on).
:::

The Bell states form an orthonormal basis in the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_1\otimes\mathcal{H}_2$ of two qubits.
We can perform measurements in the Bell basis: the easiest way to do it in practice is to "rotate" the Bell basis to the standard basis, and then perform the measurement in the standard basis.^[For any state $\ket{\psi}$ of two qubits, the amplitude $\braket{\psi_{ij}}{\psi}$ can be written as $\braket{ij}{U^\dagger|\psi}$, where $U^\dagger$ is such that $\ket{\psi_{ij}} = U\ket{ij}$.]
Indeed, if we reverse the circuit (running it from right to left), then we get a circuit which maps the Bell state $\ket{\psi_{ij}}$ to the corresponding state $\ket{ij}$ in the standard basis.
This unitary mapping allows us to "implement" the projections on Bell states by applying the reversed circuit followed by the usual qubit-by-qubit measurement in the standard basis.

The Bell states are said to be **maximally entangled**, since their reduced density operators are maximally mixed (a notion that we will define in Section \@ref(instructive-examples)).
Roughly, this means that the outcomes of *any* measurement performed on them are completely random.
This property --- having maximal entropy (in some sense) --- makes the Bell states incredibly useful for many applications, and we shall see some of them now.






## Quantum teleportation {#quantum-teleportation}

<div class="video" title="Quantum teleportation" data-videoid="lbrO_0EImZ4"></div>

A wonderful fact, that sounds more like science fiction than actual science, is the following: *an unknown quantum state can be teleported from one location to another.*
Consider the following circuit, which is built from a Bell state generator followed by an "offset" inverse Bell state generator:^[_Divide et impera_, or "divide and conquer": a good approach to solving problems in mathematics (and in life). Start with the smaller circuits in the dashed boxes, which we have just seen introduced above.]

  \end{quantikz}
\end{equation*}
```
::::

The first input qubit (counting from the top) is in some arbitrary state.
After the action of the part of the circuit in the first dashed box (counting from the left), the state of the three qubits reads^[We don't worry about writing the normalisation factors.]
$$
  \big( \alpha\ket{0}+\beta\ket{1} \big)
  \big( \ket{00}+\ket{11} \big).
$$
By regrouping the terms, but keeping the qubits in the same order, this state can be written as the sum
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    &(\ket{00} + \ket{11}) \otimes (\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})
  \\+ &(\ket{01} + \ket{10}) \otimes (\alpha\ket{1} + \beta\ket{0})
  \\+ &(\ket{00} - \ket{11}) \otimes (\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1})
  \\+ &(\ket{01} - \ket{10}) \otimes (\alpha\ket{1} - \beta\ket{0}).
  \end{aligned}
$$
Then the part of the circuit in the second dashed box maps the four Bell states of the first two qubits to the corresponding states from the computational basis:
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    &\ket{00} \otimes (\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})
  \\+ &\ket{01} \otimes (\alpha\ket{1} + \beta\ket{0})
  \\+ &\ket{10} \otimes (\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1})
  \\+ &\ket{11} \otimes (\alpha\ket{1} - \beta\ket{0}).
  \end{aligned}
$$
Upon performing the standard measurement and learning the values of $x$ and $y$, we choose one of the four following transformations depending on these values:
$$
  \begin{array}{ll}
    00 \mapsto \id
    &\quad 01 \mapsto X
  \\[1em]
    10 \mapsto Z
    &\quad 11 \mapsto ZX
  \end{array}
\tag{$\circledast$}
$$
(e.g. if $x=0$ and $y=1$, then we choose $X$).
We then apply this transformation to the third qubit, which restores the original state of the first qubit.

If you understand how this circuit works^[You can play around with this on the [Quantum Flytrap Virtual Lab](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/lab/quantum-teleportation?mode=laser).], then you are ready for quantum teleportation.
Here is a dramatic version.

This raises a natural "philosophical" question: what do we really *mean* by teleportation?
A key part of this question is understanding what happens to our original qubit when we teleport it.
Note that the actual physical electron (or whatever implementation of qubits we are using) does not suddenly move through space --- what is teleported is the *state* of the qubit, but the argument can be made that if two qubits are entirely indistinguishable from one another by any measurements that we can make, then they really are "the same" in every way that matters, and so the qubit which now has the original qubit's state "is the same as" the original qubit.
As it turns out, this process necessarily *destroys* the original qubit's state, as we now explain.

::: {.technical title="Teleportation experiments and verification" latex="{Teleportation experiments and verification}"}
The first actual teleportation experiment was successfully achieved in 1997 (arXiv:[quant-ph/9710013](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9710013)); in 2012 a record distance was set: an entangled photon pair was used to teleport a state 143 kilometres/88 miles (arXiv:[1205.3909](https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3909)); in 2017, successful ground-to-satellite teleportation was achieved (arXiv:[1707.00934](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00934)).
This is not science fiction!

But there is a fundamental question to ask: if the original state is destroyed, then how can we really verify that teleportation has taken place?
We can't compare the purportedly teleported state to the original one!
The answer to this involves certain [**no-go theorems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-go_theorem) and statistical methods, where we can show that classical physics gives some strict upper bound on a certain fidelity, but which is clearly surpassed by these physical experiments.
We will better explain the ideas behind these sorts of arguments later on, in Chapter \@ref(bells-theorem), when we introduce **Bell's theorem**.

## No-cloning, and other no-go theorems {#no-cloning-and-no-go}

<div class="video" title="Quantum cloning" data-videoid="sy3I932usMQ"></div>

Let us now look at something that the controlled-$\NOT$ *seems* to be doing but, in fact, *isn't*.
It is easy to see that the $\cNOT$ can copy the bit value of the first qubit:
$$
  \ket{x}\ket{0} \xmapsto{\cNOT} \ket{x}\ket{x}
  \qquad\text{(for $x=0,1$)}
$$
so one might suppose that this gate could also be used to copy superpositions, such as $\ket{\psi} = \alpha\ket{0}+\beta\ket{1}$, so that
$$
  \ket{\psi}\ket{0} \xmapsto{\cNOT} \ket{\psi}\ket{\psi}
$$
for *any* $\ket{\psi}$.
*But this is not true!*

The unitarity of the $\cNOT$ means that it turns *superpositions* in the control qubit into *entanglement* of the control and the target: if the control qubit is in the a superposition state $\ket{\psi} = \alpha\ket{0}+\beta\ket{1}$ (with $\alpha,\beta\neq0$), and the target is in $\ket{0}$, then the $\cNOT$ gate generates the entangled state
$$
  \big( \alpha\ket{0}+\beta\ket{1} \big) \ket{0}
  \xmapsto{\cNOT}
  \alpha\ket{00} + \beta\ket{11}.
$$
In fact, it is _impossible_ to clone an unknown quantum state, and we can prove this!

To prove this via contradiction, let us assume that we *could* build a universal quantum cloner, and then take any two normalised states $\ket{\psi}$ and $\ket{\phi}$ that are *non-identical* (i.e. $|\braket{\psi}{\phi}|\neq1$) and *non-orthogonal* (i.e. $\braket{\psi}{\phi}\neq0$).
If we then run our hypothetical cloning machine we get
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \ket{\psi}\ket{0}\ket{W}
    &\longmapsto \ket{\psi}\ket{\psi}\ket{W'}
  \\\ket{\phi}\ket{0}\ket{W}
    &\longmapsto \ket{\phi}\ket{\phi}\ket{W''}
  \end{aligned}
$$
where the third system, initially in state $\ket{W}$, represents everything else (say, the internal state of the cloning machine).
For this transformation to be unitary, it must preserve the inner product, and so we require that
$$
  \braket{\psi}{\phi}
  = \braket{\psi}{\phi}^2 \braket{W'}{W''}
$$
which can only be satisfied if $|\braket{\psi}{\phi}|$ is equal to $1$ or $0$, but this contradicts our assumptions!

Thus, states of qubits, unlike states of classical bits, cannot be faithfully cloned.
Note that, in quantum teleportation, the original state must therefore be _destroyed_, since otherwise we would be producing a clone of an unknown quantum state.
The no-cloning property of quantum states leads to interesting applications, of which quantum cryptography is one.

Universal quantum cloners are _impossible_.

::: {.todo latex=""}
<!-- TO-DO: approximate cloners can still exist! -->
:::
::::

The no-cloning theorem is one of many so-called "no-go" theorems in quantum information.
We won't look at all of them in depth, but it's worth mentioning them here and giving a very rough idea of what each one says.

- **No-teleportation.**
  *An arbitrary quantum state cannot be entirely expressed with classical information.*
  *In other words, the process of converting quantum information to classical information cannot be reversed: classical channels cannot transmit quantum information.*

  This can be seen as a consequence of no-cloning: if we were able to turn a quantum state into classical information and then back again, we could simply clone the classical information and then get a cloned copy of our quantum state.

  The name is a bit confusing, because we have just seen that *quantum* teleportation is possible through the use of entanglement, but it refers to the idea of *classical* teleportation of quantum states.

  Note that the "converse" to this is possible though: if we start with some *classical* information then we can convert it to quantum information and then back again perfectly fine (for example, using the fact that orthogonal states can be perfectly distinguished).

- **No-broadcasting.**
  *Given a single copy of a quantum state, it cannot be shared with two or more parties.*

  This is an even more direct consequence of no-cloning: if we can't copy a state, then we have no way of sharing it with multiple people.
  However, the real technical statement of this theorem involves **non-pure states**, which require the language of **density operators** to talk about --- something that we will not see until Chapter \@ref(density-matrices).

  One particularly unexpected detail here is that the theorem is no longer true if we're provided with more than one copy of the state to start with.
  For example, in a process known as **superbroadcasting**^[This is shown in D'Ariano, Macchiavello, and Perinotti's "Superbroadcasting of mixed states", arXiv:[quant-ph/0506251](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506251).], given four copies of an input state we can actually broadcast six copies!

- **No-deleting.**
  *Given two copies of an arbitrary quantum state, it is impossible to delete one.*

  You might hear people saying that the fact that we require our quantum operations to be unitary is to do with **reversibility**^[In fact, we'll talk a bit about reversibility of computation in Section \@ref(quantum-boolean-function-evaluation).], and so there is a general pattern in quantum theory where theorems will have **time-dual** versions, giving by taking the same theorem but imagining that time goes in the opposite direction.
  No-deleting is the time dual of no-cloning, and whereas the latter tells us that quantum states are pretty delicate, the former tells us that they are also in some sense rather robust.

  We might as well state this theorem a bit more precisely, because we have seen almost all of the necessary definitions already: given a qubit in an unknown state $\ket{\psi}$, there is no **isometry** $V$ (Section \@ref(random-isometries)) such that
  $$
    V\colon
    \ket{\psi}\ket{\psi}\ket{W}
    \longmapsto
    \ket{\psi}\ket{0}\ket{W'}
  $$
  with $\ket{W'}$ being independent of $\ket{\psi}$.
  Just as for no-cloning, we can of course delete *some qubits* (for example those in orthogonal states, since these behave a lot like classical bits), but there is no $V$ that works universally, for *any* arbitrary state $\ket{\psi}$.

- **No-communication.**
  *An entangled state cannot be used to transmit information by measurement of a subsystem.*

  We talk about this theorem in the context of a worked example in Exercise \@ref(instantaneous-communication), and we delve into the details when we talk about **Bell tests** in Chapter \@ref(bells-theorem), but it is basically the answer to Einstein's worry about "spooky action at a distance" that we mentioned back in Section \@ref(a-very-brief-history): the seemingly infinitely fast sending of information between entangled qubits cannot actually send any meaningful information, but only purely random bits.

  This theorem is actually stronger than no-cloning, in that we can prove no-cloning from no-communication.

  Yet again we see another example of how the quantum whole is much greater than the sum of its parts: no-teleportation says that classical channels alone cannot send quantum information; no-communication says that entanglement and measurement alone cannot send quantum information; the quantum teleportation protocol of Section \@ref(quantum-teleportation) says that you *can* send quantum information *if you combine both methods together*.

- **No-hiding.**
  *Quantum information cannot be lost, even through decoherence.*

  This theorem is related to no-deletion, in that it shows the robustness of quantum states.
  In Chapter \@ref(decoherence-and-recoherence) we will study the notion of **decoherence**, which is sort of like "quantum noise", and is one of the main problems faced when actually trying to design and build quantum computers in reality.
  The no-hiding theorem says that, when quantum information is "lost" through decoherence, it actually merely moves into the subspace corresponding to the environment --- *we* might have lost it, but nature hasn't.^[This theorem is of particular interest to physicists studying black holes, since it leads to the [**black hole information paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox).]





## Controlled-phase and controlled-U

Needless to say, not everything is about the controlled-$\NOT$ gate.
Another common two-qubit gate is the **controlled-phase** gate, denoted $\texttt{c-}P_\varphi$.

\end{tabular}
:::

We can also represent the $\texttt{c-}P_\varphi$ gate using the circuit notation, as in Figure \@ref(fig:c-phase-diagram).

(ref:c-phase-diagram-caption) Where $x,y\in\{0,1\}$.

```{r c-phase-diagram,engine='tikz',engine.opts=list(template="latex/tikz2pdf.tex"),fig.cap='(ref:c-phase-diagram-caption)'}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{quantikz}
    \lstick{$\ket{x}$}

  \\\lstick{$\ket{y}$}
    & \ctrl{-1} \qw
    & \qw
  \end{quantikz}
\end{equation*}
```

Again, the matrix is written in the computational basis $\{\ket{00},\ket{01},\ket{10},\ket{11}\}$.
If we do not specify the phase then we usually assume that $\varphi=\pi$, in which case we call this operation the **controlled-$Z$ gate**, which acts as $\proj{0}\otimes\id + \proj{1}\otimes Z$.
Here $Z$ refers again to the Pauli phase-flip $\sigma_z\equiv Z$ operation.

In order to see the entangling power of the controlled-phase shift gate, consider the following circuit.

:::: {.circuit latex=""}

```{r,engine='tikz',engine.opts=list(template="latex/tikz2pdf.tex")}

  \\\lstick{$\ket{0}$}
    & \gate{H}
    & \ctrl{-1}
    & \qw
  \end{quantikz}
\end{equation*}
```
::::

In this circuit, first the two Hadamard gates prepare the equally-weighted superposition of all states from the computational basis

```{r,engine='tikz',engine.opts=list(template="latex/tikz2pdf.tex")}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{quantikz}
    \lstick{$\ket{0}$}
    & \gate{H}
    & \qw \rstick[wires=2]{$\frac{1}{2}\big(\ket{00}+\ket{01}+\ket{10}+\ket{11}\big)$}
  \\\lstick{$\ket{0}$}
    & \gate{H}
    & \qw
  \end{quantikz}
\end{equation*}
```

and then the controlled-$Z$ operation flips the sign in front of $\ket{11}$

```{r,engine='tikz',engine.opts=list(template="latex/tikz2pdf.tex")}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{quantikz}
    \lstick{$\ket{0}$}
    & \gate{H}
    & \ctrl{1}
    & \qw \rstick[wires=2]{$\frac{1}{2}\big(\ket{00}+\ket{01}+\ket{10}-\ket{11}\big)$}
  \\\lstick{$\ket{0}$}
    & \gate{H}
    & \ctrl{-1}
    & \qw
  \end{quantikz}
\end{equation*}
```

which results in an entangled state.

In fact, both $\cNOT$ and $\texttt{c-}P_\varphi$ are specific examples of the more general construction of a **controlled-$U$ gate**:
$$
  \texttt{c-}U
  = \proj{0}\otimes\id + \proj{1}\otimes U
$$
where $U$ is an arbitrary single-qubit unitary transformation $U$.

We can also represent the $\texttt{c-}U$ gate using the circuit notation, as in Figure \@ref(fig:c-U-diagram).

(ref:c-U-diagram-caption) The controlled-$U$ gate, where $x,y\in\{0,1\}$.

```{r c-U-diagram,engine='tikz',engine.opts=list(template="latex/tikz2pdf.tex"),fig.cap='(ref:c-U-diagram-caption)'}

    & \qw
  \end{quantikz}
\end{equation*}
```

We can go even further and consider a more general unitary operation: the two-qubit **$x$-controlled-$U$ gate**:
$$
  \sum_x \proj{x}\otimes U_x
  \equiv
  \proj{0}\otimes U_0 + \proj{1}\otimes U_1
$$
where each $U_x$ is a unitary transformation that is applied to the second qubit only if the first one is in state $\ket{x}$.
In general, an $x$-controlled-$U$ gate can be defined on two registers of arbitrary size $n$ and $m$, with $x\in\{0,1\}^n$ and the $U_x$ being $(2^m\times 2^m)$ unitary matrices acting on the second register.






## Universality, revisited

<div class="video" title="Universal sets of gates (for multiple qubits)" data-videoid="IzyAY6US5C4"></div>

We will come across few more gates in this course, but at this stage you already know all the elementary unitary operations that are needed to construct any unitary operation on any number of qubits:

- the Hadamard gate,
- all phase gates, and
- the $\cNOT$

These gates form a **universal set of gates**: with $\mathcal{O}(4^{n}n)$ of these gates, we can construct any $n$-qubit unitary operation.^[Recall the big-$\mathcal{O}$ asymptotic notation introduced in Exercise \@ref(big-o): given a _positive_ function $f(n)$, we write $\mathcal{O}(f(n))$ to mean "bounded above by $c\,f(n)$ for some constant $c > 0$ (for sufficiently large $n$)". For example, $15n^2+4n+7$ is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.]
We should mention that there are many different universal sets of gates.
In fact, almost any gate that can entangle two qubits can be used as a universal gate.

We are particularly interested in any *finite* universal set of gates^[One particular example that we will see again is the Hadamard, $\cNOT$, and $T=P_{\pi/4}$.] that can approximate any unitary operation on $n$ qubits with arbitrary precision.
The price to pay is the number of gates --- better precision requires more gates.





## Phase kick-back {#phase-kick-back}

Before moving on, we first describe a simple yet omnipresent "trick" --- an unusual way of introducing phase shifts that will be essential for our analysis of quantum algorithms.
Consider the following circuit.

:::: {.circuit latex=""}
::: {.circuit-title}
*(Controlled-$U$ interference).*
:::

```{r,engine='tikz',engine.opts=list(template="latex/tikz2pdf.tex")}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{quantikz}
    \lstick{$\ket{0}$}
    & \gate{H}
    & \ctrl{1}
    & \gate{H}
    & \qw \rstick{$\cos\frac{\varphi}{2}\ket{0} - i\sin\frac{\varphi}{2}\ket{1}$}
  \\\lstick{$\ket{u}$}
    & \qw
    & \gate{U}
    & \qw
    & \qw \rstick{$\ket{u}$}
  \end{quantikz}
\end{equation*}
```
where $\ket{u}$ is an _eigenstate_ of $U$, so that $U\ket{u} = e^{i\varphi}\ket{u}$ for some $\varphi$.
::::

This should look familiar: it is the usual interference circuit, but with the phase gate replaced by a controlled-$U$ gate, which will mimic the phase gate, as we shall soon see.
Note that the second qubit is prepared in state $\ket{u}$, which is _required to be an eigenstate of $U$_.
The circuit effects the following sequence of transformations:^[Omitting, as per usual, the normalisation factors.]
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \ket{0}\ket{u}
    &\xmapsto{H}
    (\ket{0}+\ket{1})\ket{u}
  \\&\quad = \ket{0}\ket{u} + \ket{1}\ket{u}
  \\&\xmapsto{\texttt{c-}U}
    \ket{0}\ket{u} + \ket{1}U\ket{u}
  \\&\quad = \ket{0}\ket{u} + e^{i\varphi}\ket{1}\ket{u}
  \\&\quad = (\ket{0} + e^{i\varphi}\ket{1}) \ket{u}
  \\&\xmapsto{H}
    \left(
      \cos\frac{\varphi}{2}\ket{0}
      - i\sin\frac{\varphi}{2}\ket{1}
    \right) \ket{u}.
  \end{aligned}
$$
Note that the second qubit does *not* get entangled with the first one: it remains in its original state $\ket{u}$.
However, the interaction between the two qubits introduces a phase shift on the first qubit.
This may look like an unnecessarily complicated way of introducing phase shifts, but, as we shall soon see, this is how quantum computers do it.
Here is a preview of things to come.

Consider the following $x$-controlled-$U$ operation:
$$
  \left[
    \begin{array}{cccc}
      \id & 0 & 0 & 0
    \\0 & \id & 0 & 0
    \\0 & 0 & \id & 0
    \\0 & 0 & 0 & X
    \end{array}
  \right]
  = \begin{aligned}
    \proj{00}&\otimes\id
  \\+\,\,\proj{01}&\otimes\id
  \\+\,\,\proj{10}&\otimes\id
  \\+\,\,\proj{11}&\otimes X.
  \end{aligned}
$$
The first register is of size $2$ (corresponding to the top-left $2\times 2$ block, which is simply the identity matrix), and the second register is of size $1$ (corresponding to the two bottom-right $1\times1$ blocks, namely an identity matrix and $X$).
If the first register is prepared in state $\ket{11}$, then the qubit in the second register is flipped (by the Pauli bit-flip $X$); otherwise, nothing happens.

This unitary operation is a quantum version of the Boolean function evaluation: it corresponds to the Boolean function
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    f\colon\{0,1\}^2 &\longrightarrow \{0,1\}
  \\00&\longmapsto0
  \\01&\longmapsto0
  \\10&\longmapsto0
  \\11&\longmapsto1.
  \end{aligned}
$$
If $f(x)=1$, then we flip the bit value in the second register (with operation $X$); if $f(x)=0$, then we do nothing.

Now, prepare the qubit in the second register in state $\ket{0}-\ket{1}$, which is an eigenstate of $X$ with eigenvalue $e^{\pi i}=-1$.
So whenever $X$ is applied to the second register, the phase factor $-1$ appears in front of the corresponding term in the first register.
If we prepare the first register in the superposition $\ket{00}+\ket{01}+\ket{10}+\ket{11}$ then the result of applying the above $x$-controlled-$U$ operation is the entangled state $\ket{00}+\ket{01}+\ket{10}-\ket{11}$.
That is, *the **phase kick-back** mechanism introduces a relative phase in the equally-weighted superposition of all binary strings of length two*.

::: {.idea latex=""}
Phase kick-back is how we control quantum interference in quantum computation.

We will return to this topic later on in Section \@ref(more-phase-kick-back), when we discuss quantum evaluation of Boolean functions and quantum algorithms.





## Density operators, and other things to come

The existence of entangled states leads to an obvious question: if we cannot attribute a state vector to an individual qubit, then how can we describe its quantum state?
In the next few chapters we will see that, when we limit our attentions to a part of a larger system, states are not represented by vectors, measurements are not described by orthogonal projections, and evolution is not unitary.
As a spoiler, here is a dictionary of some of the new concepts that will soon be introduced:

| | | |
| -: | :-: | :- |
| state vectors | $\rightsquigarrow$ | density operators |
| orthogonal projectors | $\rightsquigarrow$ | positive operator-valued measures |
| unitary evolutions | $\rightsquigarrow$ | completely-positive trace-preserving maps |






## *Remarks and exercises* {#remarks-and-exercises-entanglement}

### Why qubits, subsystems, and entanglement?

<div class="video" title="Why qubits?" data-videoid="0AU6U7bcEh0"></div>

One question that is rather natural to ask at this point is the following:

> If entanglement is so fragile and difficult to control, then why bother?
> Why not perform your computations in one singly physical system that has as many quantum states as we normally have labels for the states of qubits?
> Then we could label these quantum states in the same way as we normally label the qubits, and give *them* computational meaning.

This suggestion, although possible, gives a very inefficient way of representing data, known as the **unary encoding**.
For serious computations, we *need* subsystems.
Here is why.

Suppose you have $n$ physical objects, and each object has $k$ distinguishable states.
If you can access each object *separately* and put it into any of the $k$ states, then, with only $n$ operations, you can prepare any of the $k^{n}$ different configurations of the combined systems.
Without any loss of generality, let us take $k=2$ and refer to each object of this type as a **physical bit**.
We label the two states of a physical bit as $0$ and $1$.
So any collection of $n$ physical bits can be prepared in $2^{n}$ different configurations, which can be used to store up to $2^{n}$ numbers (or binary strings, or messages, or however you want to interpret these things).
In order to represent numbers from $0$ to $N-1$ we just have to choose $n$ such that $2^n\geq N$.

Suppose the two states in the physical bit are separated by the energy difference $\Delta_E>0$, i.e. that it costs $\Delta_E$ units of energy to switch a physical bit from one state to the other.
Then a preparation of any particular configuration will cost no more than $E=n \Delta_E=(\log_2 N)\Delta_E$ units of energy.^[For simplicity here, we're assuming that $N=2^n$.]

In contrast, if we choose to encode $N$ configurations into one chunk of matter, say, into the first $N$ energy states of a single harmonic oscillator with the same energy separation $\Delta_E$ between states, then, in the worst case (i.e. going from the ground state $0$ to the most excited state $N$) one has to use $E=N\Delta_E$ units of energy.
For large $N$ this gives an exponential gap in the energy expenditure between the binary encoding using physical bits, and the unary encoding using energy levels of harmonic oscillators: $(\log_2 N)\Delta_E$ vs $N\Delta_E$.

Of course, you might try to switch to a different choice of realisation for the unary encoding, such as a quantum system that has a finite spread in the energy spectrum.
For example, by operating on the energy states of the hydrogen atom, you can encode any number from $0$ to $N-1$, and we are guaranteed not to spend more than $E_{\mathrm{max}}=$ $13.6\,\mathrm{eV}$ (otherwise the atom is ionised).
The snag is that, in this case, some of the electronic states will be separated by an energy difference to the order of $E_{\mathrm{max}}/N$, and to drive the system selectively from one state to another one has to tune into the frequency $E_{\mathrm{max}}/\hbar N$, which requires a sufficiently long [**wave packet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_packet) in order for the frequency to be well defined, and consequently the
interaction time is of order $N(\hbar/E_{\mathrm{max}})$.

That is, we spend *less energy*, but the trade off is that we have to spend *more time*.

It turns out that whichever way we try to represent the number $N$ in the unary encoding (i.e. using $N$ different states of a single chunk of matter), we end up depleting our physical resources (such as energy or time, or even space) at a much greater rate than in the case when we use subsystems.
This plausibility argument indicates that, for efficient processing of information, the system must be divided into subsystems --- for example, into physical bits.


### Entangled or not? {#entangled-or-not}

<div class="video" title="Shared randomness" data-videoid="lHTSQxii0t0"></div>

Let a joint state of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be written in a product basis as
$$
  \ket{\psi} = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij}\ket{a_i}\otimes\ket{b_j}.
$$
Assume that $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$ are of equal dimension.

1. Show that, if $\ket{\psi}$ is a product state, then $\det (c_{ij}) = 0$.

2. Show that the converse ($\det(c_{ij})=0\implies\ket{\psi}=\ket{a}\ket{b}$) holds only for qubits. Explain why.

3. Deduce that the state
  $$
    \frac{1}{2}\big(\ket{00} + \ket{01} + \ket{10} + (-1)^k\ket{11}\big)
  $$
  is entangled for odd values of $k$ and unentangled for even values of $k$. Express the latter case explicitly as a product state.


### Instantaneous communication {#instantaneous-communication}

There is a lot of interesting physics behind the innocuous-looking mathematical statement of Exercise \@ref(entangled-or-not).
For example, think again about the state $(\ket{00}+\ket{11})/\sqrt{2}$.
What happens if you measure just the first qubit?
It is equally likely that you get $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$, right?
But after your measurement the two qubits are either in state $\ket{00}$ or in $\ket{11}$, i.e. they show the same bit value.
Now, why might that be disturbing?
Well, imagine the second qubit to be light-years away from the first one.
It seems that the measurement of the first qubit affects the second qubit right away, which seems to imply faster-than-light communication!
This is what Einstein called "spooky action as a distance" in his 1947 letter to Max Born.

But can you actually use this effect to send a message faster than light?
What would happen if you tried?

Hopefully you can see that it would not work, since the result of the measurement is random: you cannot choose the bit value you want to send.
We shall return to this, and other related phenomena, later on --- it is not at all a lost cause!



### SWAP circuit {#swap-circuit}

Show that, for any states $\ket{\psi_1}$ and $\ket{\psi_2}$ of two qubits, the circuit below implements the $\texttt{SWAP}$ operation $\ket{\psi_1}\ket{\psi_2} \mapsto \ket{\psi_2}\ket{\psi_1}$.

  \end{quantikz}
\end{equation*}
```
::::


### Measuring with controlled-NOT

The controlled-$\NOT$ gate can act as a measurement gate: if you prepare the target in state $\ket{0}$ then the gate acts as $\ket{x}\ket{0}\mapsto\ket{x}\ket{x}$, and so the target learns the bit value of the control qubit.
If you wish, you can think about a subsequent measurement of the target qubit in the computational basis as an observer learning about the bit value of the control qubit.

Take a look at the circuit below, where $M$ stands for measurement in the standard basis.

:::: {.circuit latex=""}
::: {.circuit-title}
*(?).*
:::

```{r,engine='tikz',engine.opts=list(template="latex/tikz2pdf.tex")}

Now assume that the top two qubits are in the state
$$
  \ket{\psi}
  = \frac{1}{\sqrt3}\big( \ket{01} - \ket{10} + i\ket{11} \big).
$$
The measurement $M$ gives two possible outcomes: $0$ and $1$.
What are the probabilities of each outcome, and what is the post-measurement state in each case?

What is this circuit actually measuring?


### Arbitrary controlled-U on two qubits

Recall Section \@ref(universality-again): any unitary operation $U$ on a single qubit can be expressed as
$$
  U = B^\dagger XBA^\dagger XA
$$
for some unitaries $A$ and $B$, where $X\equiv\sigma_x$ is the Pauli bit-flip operator.

Suppose that you can implement any single-qubit gate, and that you have a bunch of controlled-$\NOT$ gates at your disposal.
How would you implement any controlled-$U$ operation on two qubits?


### Entangled qubits

Two entangled qubits in the state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00}+\ket{11})$ are generated by some source $S$.
One qubit is sent to Alice, and one to Bob, who then both perform measurements in the computational basis.

1. What is the probability that Alice and Bob will register identical results?
  Can any correlations they observe be used for instantaneous communication?

2. Prior to the measurements in the computational basis, Alice and Bob apply unitary operations $R_\alpha$ and $R_\beta$ (respectively), for some fixed values $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{R}$, to their respective qubits:

  ```{r,engine='tikz',fig.width=4}
  \definecolor{primary}{RGB}{177,98,78}
  \definecolor{secondary}{RGB}{91,132,177}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (0,0) circle (0.4cm) node {$S$};
    \draw [->,primary] (0.3,0.3) to (1,1) to (3.8,1) node [right] {Alice};
    \draw [->,secondary] (0.3,-0.3) to (1,-1) to (3.8,-1) node [right] {Bob};
    \node [draw,fill=white] at (2,1) {$R_\alpha$};
    \draw [fill=gray!15] (3,0.7) arc (-90:90:0.3cm) to cycle;
    \node [draw,fill=white] at (2,-1) {$R_\beta$};
    \draw [fill=gray!15] (3,-1.3) arc (-90:90:0.3cm) to cycle;
  \end{tikzpicture}
  ```

  where the gate $R_\theta$ is defined by its action on the basis states:
  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      \ket{0}
      &\longmapsto
      \cos\theta\ket{0} + \sin\theta\ket{1}
    \\\ket{1}
      &\longmapsto
      -\sin\theta\ket{0} + \cos\theta\ket{1}.
    \end{aligned}
  $$
  Show that the state of the two qubits prior to the measurements is
  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      &\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cos(\alpha-\beta)\big( \ket{00} + \ket{11} \big)
    \\- &\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sin(\alpha-\beta)\big( \ket{01} - \ket{10} \big).
    \end{aligned}
  $$

3. What is the probability that Alice and Bob's outcomes are identical?

4. What is the geometric interpretation of the operator $R_\theta$?


### Quantum dense coding {#quantum-dense-coding}

::: {.todo latex=""}
<!-- TO-DO -->

### Playing with conditional unitaries

The swap gate $\texttt{SWAP}$ on two qubits is defined first on product vectors by $\texttt{SWAP}\colon\ket{a}\ket{b}\mapsto\ket{b}\ket{a}$ and then extended to sums of product vectors by linearity (see Exercise \@ref(swap-circuit)).

1. Show that the four Bell states $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00}\pm\ket{11})$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{01}\pm\ket{10})$ are eigenvectors of $\texttt{SWAP}$ that form an orthonormal basis in the Hilbert space associated to two qubits.
  Which Bell states span the _symmetric subspace_ (i.e. the space spanned by all eigenvectors with eigenvalue $1$), and which the _antisymmetric_ one (i.e. that spanned by eigenvectors with eigenvalue $-1$)?
  Can $\texttt{SWAP}$ have any eigenvalues apart from $\pm1$?

2. Show that $P_\pm = \frac{1}{2}(\id\pm \texttt{SWAP})$ are two orthogonal projectors which form the decomposition of the identity and project onto the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces.
  Decompose the state vector $\ket{a}\ket{b}$ of two qubits into symmetric and antisymmetric components.

3. Consider the quantum circuit below, composed of two Hadamard gates, one controlled-$\texttt{SWAP}$ operation (also known as the **controlled-swap**, or [**Fredkin** gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredkin_gate)), and the measurement $M$ in the computational basis.
  Suppose that the state vectors $\ket{a}$ and $\ket{b}$ are normalised but _not_ orthogonal to one another.
  Step through the execution of this network, writing down the quantum states of the three qubits after each of the four computational steps.
  What are the probabilities of observing $0$ or $1$ when the measurement $M$ is finally performed?

4. Explain why this quantum network implements projections on the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces of the two qubits.

5. Two qubits are transmitted through a quantum channel which applies the same randomly chosen unitary operation $U$ to each of them, i.e. $U\otimes U$.
  Show that the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces are invariant under this operation.

6. Polarised photons are transmitted through an optical fibre.
  Due to the variation of the refractive index along the fibre, the polarisation of each photon is rotated by the same unknown angle.
  This makes communication based on polarisation encoding unreliable.
  However, if you are able to prepare *any* polarisation state of the two photons then you can still use the channel to communicate without any errors --- how?


### Tensor products in components

In our discussion of tensor products we have so far taken a rather abstract approach.
There are, however, situations in which we have to put numbers in, and write tensor products of vectors and matrices explicitly.
For example, here is the standard basis of two qubits written explicitly as column vectors:^[We always use the lexicographic order $00<01<10<11$.]
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \ket{00} &\equiv \ket{0}\otimes\ket{0}
    = \bmqty{1\\0} \otimes \bmqty{1\\0}
    = \bmqty{1\\0\\0\\0}
  \\[1em]
    \ket{01} &\equiv \ket{0}\otimes\ket{1}
    = \bmqty{1\\0} \otimes \bmqty{0\\1}
    = \bmqty{0\\1\\0\\0}
  \\[1em]
    \ket{10} &\equiv \ket{1}\otimes\ket{0}
    = \bmqty{0\\1} \otimes \bmqty{1\\0}
    = \bmqty{0\\0\\1\\0}
  \\[1em]
    \ket{11} &\equiv \ket{1}\otimes\ket{1}
    = \bmqty{0\\1} \otimes \bmqty{0\\1}
    = \bmqty{0\\0\\0\\1}
  \end{aligned}
$$
Given $\ket{a} = \alpha_0\ket{0} + \alpha_1\ket{1}$ and $\ket{b} = \beta_0\ket{0} +\beta_1\ket{1}$, we write $\ket{a}\otimes\ket{b}$ as
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \ket{a}\otimes\ket{b}
    &= \bmqty{\alpha_0\\\alpha_1} \otimes \bmqty{\beta_0\\\beta_1}
  \\&= \bmqty{\alpha_0\bmqty{\beta_0\\\beta_1}\\\alpha_1\bmqty{\beta_0\\\beta_1}}
  \\&= \bmqty{\alpha_0\beta_0\\\alpha_0\beta_1\\\alpha_1\beta_0\\\alpha_1\beta_1}.
  \end{aligned}
$$
Note that each element of the first vector multiplies the entire second vector.
This is often the easiest way to get the tensor products in practice.

The matrix elements of the tensor product operation $A\otimes B$

```{r,engine='tikz',engine.opts=list(template="latex/tikz2pdf.tex")}
\begin{equation*}

$$

where $ik\in\{00,01,10,11\}$ labels the rows, and $kl\in\{00,01,10,11\}$ labels columns, when forming the block matrix:

::: {.technical title="The Kronecker product" latex="{The Kronecker product}"}
This product $A\otimes B$ also known as the [**Kronecker product**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product) of matrices, which generalises the [**outer product**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_product) of two vectors that we saw in Section \@ref(outer-products).
:::

The tensor product induces a natural partition of matrices into blocks.
Multiplication of block matrices works pretty much the same as regular matrix multiplication (assuming the dimensions of the sub-matrices are appropriate), except that the entries are now matrices rather than numbers, and so may not commute.

1. Evaluate the following matrix product of $(4\times 4)$ block matrices:
  $$
    \left[
    \,
      \begin{array}{c|c}
        \id & X
      \\\hline
        Y & Z
      \end{array}
    \,
    \right]
    \left[
    \,
      \begin{array}{c|c}
        \id & Y
      \\\hline
        X & Z
      \end{array}
    \,
    \right]
  $$
  (where $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are the Pauli matrices).

2. Using the block matrix form of $A\otimes B$ expressed in terms of $A_{ij}$ and $B_{ij}$ (as described above), explain how the following operations are performed on the block matrix:
    - transposition $(A\otimes B)^T$;
    - **partial transpositions** $A^T\otimes B$ and $A\otimes B^T$;
    - trace $\tr (A\otimes B)$;
    - **partial traces** $(\tr A)\otimes B$ and $A\otimes(\tr B)$.


### Hadamard transforms in components {#hadamard-transforms-in-components}

Consider the Hadamard transform $H\otimes H\otimes H$ on three qubits, which is described by a $(2^3\times2^3)$ matrix.
We know that
$$
  H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\bmqty{1&1\\1&-1}
$$
and so we can calculate that
$$
  H\otimes H
  = \frac{1}{2}
  \left[
  \,
    \begin{array}{c|c}
      \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
      & \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
    \\\hline
      \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
      & \mqty{-1&-1\\-1&1}
    \end{array}
  \,
  \right]
$$
and thus that
$$
  H\otimes H\otimes H
  = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2^3}}
  \left[
  \,
    \begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
      \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
      & \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
      & \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
      & \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
    \\\hline
      \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
      & \mqty{-1&-1\\-1&1}
      & \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
      & \mqty{-1&-1\\-1&1}
    \\\hline
      \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
      & \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
      & \mqty{-1&-1\\-1&1}
      & \mqty{-1&-1\\-1&1}
    \\\hline
      \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
      & \mqty{-1&-1\\-1&1}
      & \mqty{-1&-1\\-1&1}
      & \mqty{1&1\\1&-1}
    \end{array}
  \,
  \right].
$$
The rows and columns of $H\otimes H\otimes H$ are labelled by the triples $000,001,\ldots,111$.
Now, suppose we apply $H\otimes H\otimes H$ to the state $\ket{110}$:

``` {r,engine='tikz',engine.opts=list(template="latex/tikz2pdf.tex")}
\begin{equation*}
  \left.
    \begin{quantikz}
      \lstick{$\ket{1}$}
      & \gate{H}
      & \qw \rstick{$\frac{\ket{0}-\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$}
    \\\lstick{$\ket{1}$}
      & \gate{H}
      & \qw \rstick{$\frac{\ket{0}-\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$}
    \\\lstick{$\ket{0}$}
      & \gate{H}
      & \qw \rstick{$\frac{\ket{0}+\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$}
    \end{quantikz}
  \right\}
  = \frac{1}{2^{3/2}}
  \left(
    \begin{array}{r}
      \ket{000} + \ket{001} - \ket{010} - \ket{011}
    \\-\ket{100} - \ket{101} + \ket{110} + \ket{111}
    \end{array}
  \right)
\end{equation*}
```

1. The output state is a superposition of all binary strings: $\sum_{x\in\{0,1\}^3} c_x\ket{x}$.
  Where in the $H^{\otimes 3}$ matrix will you find the coefficients $c_x$?

Do you want to write down $H\otimes H\otimes H\otimes H$?
Probably not!
This is an exponentially growing monster and you may soon run out of space if you actually do try to write it down.
Instead, let us try to spot the pattern of the entries $\pm1$ in these matrices.

Consider again the single-qubit Hadamard gate matrix $H=(H_{ab})$, where $a,b=0,1$ are the labels for the rows and the columns.
Observe that $H_{ab}=(-1)^{ab}/\sqrt{2}$.
(This may look like a needlessly fancy way of writing the entries of the Hadamard matrix, but it will pay off in a moment).

2. Using the fact that $(A\otimes B)_{ik,jl} = A_{ij}B_{kl}$, or any other method, analyse the pattern of the $\pm1$ in the tensor product of Hadamard matrices.
  What is the entry $H^{\otimes 4}_{0101,1110}$?

3. For any two binary strings $a=(a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ and $b =(b_1,\ldots , b_n)$ of the same length we can define their "scalar" product as $a\cdot b = (a_1b_1\oplus \ldots \oplus a_n b_n)$.
  Show that, up to the constant $(1/\sqrt{2})^n$, the entry $H^{\otimes n}_{a,b}$ is $(-1)^{a\cdot b}$ for any $n$ and for any binary strings $a$ and $b$ of length $n$.

4. Show that $H^{\otimes n}$ acts as
  $$
    \ket{a}
    \longmapsto
    \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^n
    \sum_{b\in\{0,1\}^n} (-1)^{a\cdot b}\ket{b}
  $$

5. A quantum register of $10$ qubits holds the binary string $0110101001$.
  The Hadamard Transform is then applied to this register yielding a superposition of all binary strings of length $10$.
  What is the sign in front of the $\ket{0101010101}$ term?






### The Schmidt decomposition {#the-schmidt-decomposition}

An arbitrary vector in the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$ can be expanded in a product basis as
$$
  \ket{\psi}
  = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij}\ket{a_i}\ket{b_j}.
$$
Moreover, for any given joint state $\ket{\psi}$, we can find orthonormal bases, $\{\ket{\tilde{a}_i}\}$ in $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$ and $\{\ket{\tilde{b}_j}\}$ in $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$, such that $\ket{\psi}$ can be expressed as
$$
  \ket{\psi}
  = \sum_{i} d_{i}\ket{\tilde a_i}\ket{\tilde b_i},
$$
where the coefficients $d_i$ are *non-negative* numbers.
This is known as the **Schmidt decomposition** of $\ket{\psi}$.

Any bipartite state can be expressed in this form, but remember that *the bases used depend on the state being expanded*.
Indeed, given two bipartite states $\ket{\psi}$ and $\ket{\phi}$, we usually *cannot* perform the Schmidt decomposition using the *same* orthonormal bases in $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$.
The number of terms in the Schmidt decomposition is, at most, the minimum of $\dim\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$ and $\dim\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$.

The Schmidt decomposition follows from the [**singular value decomposition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)  (often abbreviated to **SVD**): *any* $(n\times m)$ matrix  $C$ can be written as
$$
  C = UDV
$$
where $U$ and $V$ are (respectively) $(n\times n)$ and $(m\times m)$ unitary matrices, and $D$ is an $(n\times m)$ diagonal matrix with real, non-negative elements in descending order $d_1\geq d_2\geq\ldots\geq d_{\min\{n,m\}}$ (and with the rest of the matrix is filled with zeros).
The elements $d_k$ are called the **singular values** of $C$.
We will return to the SVD in more detail later on, in Section \@ref(operator-decompositions).

You can visualize the SVD by thinking of $C$ as representing a linear
transformation from $m$-dimensional to $n$-dimensional Euclidean space: it maps the unit ball in the $m$-dimensional space to an ellipsoid in
the $n$-dimensional space; the singular values are the lengths of
the semi-axes of that ellipsoid; the matrices $U$ and $V$ carry
information about the locations of those axes and the vectors in
the first space which map into them.
Thus SVD tells us that the transformation $C$ consists of rotating the unit ball (the transformation $V$), stretching the $k$-th axis by a factor of $d_k$ (the transformation $D$), and then rotating the resulting ellipsoid (the transformation $U$).

Using the index notation $C_{ij} = \sum_k U_{ik}d_k V_{kj}$, we can thus apply SVD to $c_{ij}$:
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \ket{\psi}
    &= \sum_{i,j} c_{ij}\ket{a_ib_j}
  \\&= \sum_{i,j} \sum_k U_{ik}d_k V_{kj}\ket{a_ib_j}
  \\&= \sum_k d_k \left(\sum_i U_{ik}\ket{a_i}\right)\otimes\left(\sum_j V_{kj}\ket{b_j}\right).
  \end{aligned}
$$
The Schmidt decomposition of a separable state of the form
$\ket{a}\otimes\ket{b}$ is trivially just this state.
The Bell states $\Psi^+$ and $\Phi^+$ are already written in their Schmidt form, whereas $\Psi^-$ and $\Phi^-$ can be easily expressed in the Schmidt form.
For example, for $\ket{\Psi^-}$ we have $d_1 = d_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and the Schmidt basis is
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \ket{\tilde{a}_1} &= \ket{0}
  \\\ket{\tilde{a}_2} &= \ket{1}
  \\\ket{\tilde{b}_1} &= \ket{1}
  \\\ket{\tilde{b}_2} &= -\ket{0}.
  \end{aligned}
$$
The number of non-zero singular values of $c_{ij}$ is called the **rank** of $c_{ij}$, or the rank of the corresponding quantum state, or sometimes, the **Schmidt number**.
You should be able to see that all bipartite states of rank-one are separable.

The Schmidt decomposition is *almost* unique.
The ambiguity arises when we have two or more identical singular values, as, for example, in the case of the Bell states.
Then any unitary transformation of the basis vectors corresponding to a degenerate singular value, both in $\mathcal{H}_a$ and in $\mathcal{H}_b$, generates another set of basis vectors.
